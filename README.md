The Safe screen feature, a default option in mobile settings, is designed to regulate and enhance device usage safety, particularly for younger users. Utilizing the front-facing camera, safe screen leverages facial recognition technology to accurately determine the user's age. This innovative capability allows the system to categorize users by age groups and tailor the device experience accordingly.

Functionality by Age Group:
Users aged over 20:

Safe screen imposes no restrictions, granting unrestricted access to all device features.
This approach respects the autonomy and maturity of adult users, providing them the freedom to utilize the device as they prefer.
Users aged 5 to 20:

Safe screen is automatically activated during device setup or upon first use.
When a user within this age range is detected, the system initiates a prompt for setting a predetermined usage time limit.
Users can choose from predefined intervals, such as 5 or 10 minutes, to manage their sessions effectively.
